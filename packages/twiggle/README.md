## Overview

Twiggle is an innovative, minimalist frontend library that empowers developers to construct dynamic and responsive user interfaces with unparalleled clarity and efficiency. Unlike larger, more opinionated frameworks, Twiggle focuses on providing essential primitives: a custom JSX runtime for declarative UI composition, a robust reactive state management system for predictable data flow, and a lightweight client-side router for seamless navigation. Its design philosophy prioritizes a minimal runtime footprint and direct manipulation of the DOM, making it an ideal choice for projects where performance and control are paramount. Twiggle is perfect for learning the intricacies of frontend frameworks, building small to medium-sized applications, or integrating into existing projects where a lightweight, yet powerful, UI solution is needed.

## Features

Twiggle offers a carefully curated set of features, each designed to be powerful yet easy to understand and use:

*   **Custom JSX Runtime:**
    *   At its core, Twiggle provides its own JSX runtime, allowing you to write declarative UI code that feels familiar to React developers.
    *   This runtime directly translates your JSX into efficient DOM operations, bypassing the need for a virtual DOM and offering direct control over the browser's rendering engine.

*   **Minimal DOM Renderer:**
    *   Twiggle's renderer is optimized for performance and simplicity. It efficiently mounts and updates real DOM nodes and fragments.
    *   The design ensures that updates are precise and performant, leading to highly responsive user interfaces.

*   **Reactive State Primitive:**
    *   Experience predictable and manageable state with Twiggle's reactive state primitive.
    *   `createState<T>(initialValue: T)`: Easily create state variables that hold any type of data.
    *   `get()`: Retrieve the current value of a state variable.
    *   `set(newValue: T)`: Update the state, triggering automatic re-renders of components that depend on it.
    *   `runSideEffect(fn: () => void)`: A powerful mechanism to define side effects that automatically re-run when any observed state changes, providing a clean way to manage complex interactions and data flows.

*   **Client-Side Router:**
    *   Build single-page applications with ease using Twiggle's lightweight client-side router, built on the browser's History API.
    *   `Routes`: Define a collection of routes for your application.
    *   `Route({ to, element })`: Map specific URL paths (`to`) to the Twiggle component (`element`) that should be rendered.
    *   `Link({ to, children })`: A component that renders an anchor tag (`<a>`) and handles navigation internally, preventing full page reloads.
    *   `navigate(path)`: Programmatically change the current route, allowing for dynamic navigation within your application.

## Installation

To integrate Twiggle into your project, you can easily install it using your preferred Node.js package manager:

```bash
npm install twiggle
# or using yarn
yarn add twiggle
# or using pnpm
pnpm add twiggle
```

---

## Quick Start

Get your first Twiggle application up and running in minutes. This example demonstrates a simple counter application using Twiggle's state management and JSX rendering.

**1. Create your main application file (e.g., `src/main.tsx`):**

```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import { render, createState } from 'twiggle';

function Counter() {
  const count = createState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    count.set(count.get() + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter App</h1>
      <p>Count: {count.get()}</p>
      <button onclick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

const root = document.getElementById('root');
if (root) {
  render(<Counter />, root);
}
```

**2. Ensure your `index.html` has a root element:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Twiggle App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**3. Configure your `vite.config.ts` (if using Vite):**

Make sure you have `vite-plugin-twiggle` installed and configured in your Vite setup to handle JSX transformations correctly.

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import twiggle from 'vite-plugin-twiggle'; 

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    twiggle()
  ],
  esbuild: {
    jsx: 'automatic',
    jsxDev: true, // Set to false for production
    jsxImportSource: 'twiggle/client', // Ensure this points to Twiggle's client-side JSX runtime
  },
});
```

**4. Run your development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your Twiggle application should now be running in your browser!

## Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you leverage Twiggle's full potential:

### JSX & `createElement`

Twiggle's approach to UI construction is centered around JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript. When your code is compiled, JSX elements are transformed into calls to Twiggle's `createElement` function.

*   **`type`**: This argument determines the kind of element to create. It can be:
    *   A `string` (e.g., `'div'`, `'span'`, `'p'`) to create standard HTML DOM elements.
    *   The special string `'Fragment'` to create a `DocumentFragment`, useful for grouping multiple children without adding an extra node to the DOM tree.
    *   A `function` (your component) which will be invoked with `props` and is expected to return a DOM node or fragment.
*   **`props`**: An object containing attributes, event handlers, and children for the element.
    *   `children`: A special prop that can be a `string`, `number`, another Twiggle `Element`, or an `Array` of these types.
    *   **DOM Event Handlers**: Twiggle expects DOM event handlers to be named in lowercase (e.g., `onclick`, `oninput`, `onchange`), aligning with native DOM event attributes.

### Renderer

The `render(element, parent)` function is the entry point for mounting your Twiggle application into the DOM.

*   `element`: The Twiggle element (or component instance) you wish to render.
*   `parent`: The target HTML DOM element where your Twiggle application will be attached.

The current implementation is intentionally straightforward: it clears the `parent.innerHTML` and then appends the `element`. This direct approach contributes to Twiggle's small bundle size and high performance.

### State Primitive

Twiggle's state management is built around a simple yet effective reactive primitive, allowing for explicit control over data flow and UI updates.

*   **`createState<T>(initialValue: T)`**: This function initializes a new reactive state variable. It returns an object with two methods:
    *   `get(): T`: Retrieves the current value of the state. When called within a `runSideEffect`, it automatically registers the effect as a subscriber to this state.
    *   `set(newValue: T)`: Updates the state variable to `newValue`. This action triggers all registered side effects that depend on this state to re-execute.

*   **`runSideEffect(fn: () => void)`**: This function is central to Twiggle's reactivity. It executes the provided `fn` function. During its execution, any `createState().get()` calls are observed, and the `fn` is registered as a subscriber to those state variables. Consequently, whenever any of those subscribed state variables are updated via `set()`, the `fn` will automatically re-execute, ensuring your UI or other logic remains synchronized with your application's state.

This minimal reactive system, based on an effect stack and per-state subscriber lists, offers a transparent and easy-to-reason-about approach to reactivity, without the complexity of a full-blown reactive framework.

### Router

Twiggle includes a lightweight client-side router that leverages the browser's History API to enable single-page application navigation without full page reloads.

*   **`Routes` Component**: This component acts as a container for your application's route definitions. It collects all `Route` children and registers them internally.
*   **`Route({ to, element })` Component**: Defines a specific route.
    *   `to`: The URL path (e.g., `"/home"`, `"/users/:id"`) that this route will match.
    *   `element`: A function that returns the Twiggle element (component) to be rendered when this route is active.
*   **`Link({ to, children })` Component**: A convenience component that renders an HTML anchor tag (`<a>`). When clicked, it intercepts the default navigation behavior and uses Twiggle's `navigate` function to perform client-side routing.
*   **`navigate(path: string)` Function**: Allows for programmatic navigation within your application. Calling this function pushes a new entry onto the browser's history stack and triggers the router to render the corresponding route.
