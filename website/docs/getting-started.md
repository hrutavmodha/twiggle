# Getting Started

`create-twiggle-app` is the official CLI tool to bootstrap a new Twiggle project. It automates the setup of your development environment, including project structure, build configurations, and dependencies.

## Create a New Project

To create a new Twiggle project, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

**Using `npm`:**

```bash
npx create-twiggle-app my-twiggle-app
```

**Using `Yarn`:**

```bash
yarn create twiggle-app my-twiggle-app
```

**Using `pnpm`:**

```bash
pnpm create twiggle-app my-twiggle-app
```

Replace `my-twiggle-app` with your project name.

## Start the Development Server

Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-twiggle-app
npm run dev
```

Your Twiggle application will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
