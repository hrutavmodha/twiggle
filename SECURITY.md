## Security Practices

### 1. XSS Protection

- Framework **does not automatically sanitize user input** in `element` rendering.
- Developers must sanitize or escape any untrusted HTML content.
- Avoid using `innerHTML` with unsanitized content.

### 2. DOM Injection

- Avoid exposing APIs that allow arbitrary JavaScript injection from user input.
- Components like `<Routes>` and `<Link>` safely handle route strings; however, dynamic route generation must be sanitized.

### 3. Event Handling

- Inline event handlers (`onclick`) are used internally for routing.
- Never pass untrusted scripts into these handlers.
- Encourage use of framework-provided API (`navigate`) instead of raw JS evaluation.

### 4. Third-Party Dependencies

- The framework uses minimal/no dependencies.
- Keep all dependencies updated and verify their integrity with lock files.

### 5. Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Users are encouraged to enable a strong CSP:
    ```text
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self';
    style-src 'self';
    ```
    Prevents inline JS injection or malicious remote scripts.

### 6. Safe State Management

- Framework exposes createState() for reactivity.
- Developers should not bind sensitive data (like auth tokens) directly to DOM elements.
- Sensitive state should be kept in memory and never injected as raw HTML.

### 7. Route Handling

- The router validates paths using TypeScript literal types (/${string}).
- Avoid dynamic evaluation of route strings to prevent arbitrary code execution.

## Recommended Security Guidelines for Developers

1. Sanitize all user inputs before rendering.
2. Use framework API (navigate, createState) instead of manually manipulating DOM or history.
3. Keep dependencies up-to-date and monitor for CVEs.
4. Apply CSP headers in production.
5. Avoid recursive component mounting that can crash or freeze the browser.

## Disclaimer

This framework provides client-side rendering only.
Security largely depends on developer practices (input sanitization, CSP, and state handling).
The maintainers are not responsible for misuse of the framework in unsafe environments.
