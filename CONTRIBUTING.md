- Use labels appropriately (`bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).

## Coding Guidelines

- **Language**: TypeScript + JSX  
- **Syntax**: Follow Prettier / ESLint rules  
- **File Structure**:

```
/src
  /components   → JSX components
  /router       → Router logic
  /renderer     → DOM rendering utilities
  /state        → Reactive state utilities
```

- Naming conventions:
  - Functions: camelCase
  - Classes: PascalCase
  - Variables: descriptive, avoid single-letter names

---

## Testing

- Add tests for new features or fixes in `/tests`.  
- Run tests:

```
npm run test
```

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.

---

## Documentation

- Update docs for any public API change  
- Keep Markdown formatting clean  
- Include examples/screenshots when needed  

---

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets (API keys, tokens)  
- Follow guidelines in SECURITY.md  
- Report vulnerabilities privately

---
