- **Syntax**: Follow Prettier / ESLint rules
- **File Structure**:

```
/src
  /components   â†’ JSX components
  /router       â†’ Router logic
  /renderer     â†’ DOM rendering utilities
  /state        â†’ Reactive state utilities
```

- Naming conventions:
    - Functions: camelCase
    - Classes: PascalCase
    - Variables: descriptive, avoid single-letter names

---

## Testing

- Run tests:

```
npm run test
```

- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.

---

## Documentation

- Update docs for any public API change
- Keep Markdown formatting clean
- Include examples/screenshots when needed

---

## Security Considerations

- Follow guidelines in SECURITY.md
- Report vulnerabilities privately
